    "\n",
    "-   **Model design**: models meant for inference on edge devices are often designed specifically to reduce memory and/or inference time. The model in this example is a MobileNet, which like many image classification models uses a *convolution* operation to process its input, but MobileNets use a kind of convolution that is much faster and requires fewer operations than a “standard” convolution.\n",
    "-   **Model Compression**: another approach to faster inference on edge devices is model compression, a group of techniques that try to reduce the size of the model without affecting its accuracy. The model in this example is a quantized model, which means that the numeric parameters in the model are represented using fewer bits than in a “standard” model. These quantized parameters can also be processed using faster mathematical operations, potentially improving the inference time.\n",
    "-   **Hardware Acceleration**: a third popular technique to improving inference time at the edge is with hardware acceleration - using specialized computer chips, GPUs, or TPUs that can perform the operations involved in inference very fast. In this example, though, we are going to use CPU-based inference, which means that there is no hardware acceleration.\n",
