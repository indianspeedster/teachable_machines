# Using Machine learning models built by Teachable Machines on edge devices 

To run this experiment on Chameleon, open a terminal inside the Chameleon Jupyter environment and run

```
cd ~/work
git clone https://github.com/indianspeedster/teachable_machines
```

Then, open the notebook inside the `teachable_machines` directory and follow along with the instructions there.

> Note: This experiment assumes that you already have a lease for an edge device on CHI@Edge!
